# 🧠 Unity AI Puzzle Solver – "Thunder and Boltz"

This project is a Unity-based AI puzzle solver inspired by games like *Thunder and Boltz*, where the goal is to sort colored nuts onto bolts. The player (or AI) must avoid stacking different colors on top of each other. The AI uses a custom A* pathfinding algorithm enhanced with a heuristic system to solve complex puzzle states.

## 🎮 Features

- 🧩 Puzzle logic with movable, colored nut pieces
- ⚙️ Heuristic-based AI pathfinding (A* style)
- 🧠 Memory-efficient design for large state space search
- 🪛 Intelligent move scoring and pruning to avoid wasteful actions
- 📊 Debugging + step-by-step path replay
- 🔳 UI feedback during AI solving
- 🖥️ Fullscreen support for builds

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Unity-AI-Puzzle-Solver.git
```

### 2. Open in Unity
- Unity Version: `2022.3.x` (or later)
- Open the project folder from Unity Hub or Unity Editor.

### 3. Run the Scene
- Load the `MainScene.unity` file (or whatever your scene name is).
- Press `R` to begin the AI solving process.
- Use `→` / `←` to step through the solution.
- Press `Backspace` to exit playback.

### 4. Build
- Go to **File → Build Settings**, select your platform, and click **Build**.
- The game will launch in fullscreen by default.

## 🧠 How the AI Works

The AI simulates all possible moves using a **priority queue** and a **custom heuristic** that evaluates each game state based on:
- Number of misplaced colors
- Partially sorted bolts
- Penalty for wasteful or reversed moves
- Encouragement for full and sorted bolts

### Example Heuristic:
- Sorted + full bolt → bonus
- Moving sorted nuts to empty → penalty
- Mixed colors → penalty

This allows the AI to solve puzzles with millions of states in seconds.

## 💻 Controls

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| R   | Start AI solving |
| →   | Next move |
| ←   | Previous move |
| Backspace | Exit playback mode |


## ✅ To Do / Ideas
- Add difficulty levels or custom level editor
- Support mobile/touch UI
- Add "instant solve" visualization
- Visual trail of AI decisions (heatmap-style?)

## 🌐 GitHub Pages (Unity WebGL)

This repository now includes an automated GitHub Pages deployment workflow for Unity WebGL:

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`
- Trigger: push to `main`, `master`, or `work` (and manual `workflow_dispatch`)
- Output: publishes a WebGL build to GitHub Pages

### One-time setup
1. In GitHub repository settings, enable **Pages** with source set to **GitHub Actions**.
2. Add these repository secrets:
   - `UNITY_LICENSE`
   - `UNITY_EMAIL`
   - `UNITY_PASSWORD`
3. Push to one of the configured branches.

After the workflow succeeds, your public URL will be available in:
- **Actions > Deploy Unity WebGL to GitHub Pages > deploy job output**
- and under **Settings > Pages**.

> Notes:
> - The URL format is typically `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
> - The first build can take longer because Unity needs to import and cache project assets.
